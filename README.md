# Generalised-Additive-Modelling

## Description
In this university project, I used open source data provided by Public Health Scotland to forecast A&E attendances and waiting times across Scottish hospitals. It includes visualizations, details of the pre-processing and the generalised additive model fitting. 

## Note
Because this is a university project, not everything is perfect and there are some flaws in the models which have resulted in large uncertainty bands for the forecasted results. I plan on revisiting this project sometime soon to address such errors. Additionally, the data for load (A&E attendance data) is too large to upload to github, if you'd like to replicate my results with the data I used, feel free to contact me.
